## Android

> [!IMPORTANT]

### Play Store

This is the recommended way to install Hessflix on Android.

<a href='https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=tv.hessflix.client&pcampaignid=pcampaignidMKT-Other-global-all-co-prtnr-py-PartBadge-Mar2515-1'><img alt='Get it on Google Play' src='https://play.google.com/intl/en_us/badges/static/images/badges/en_badge_web_generic.png' width=250/></a>

### Manual

If your device can't access the Play Store, you can install Hessflix manually.

1. Download the latest `.apk` file from the [Releases](https://github.com/Hessflix/Client/releases) page and save it to your device.

2. Open it to start the installation. You may need to allow unknown apps to be installed on your device, as this will be disallowed by default.

## iOS/iPadOS

### Sideloadly

> [!NOTE]
> Installing using Sideloadly is the only method of using Hessflix on iOS or iPadOS at this time. See [this issue](https://github.com/Hessflix/Client/issues/40) for more information.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you are using Windows, you must install the web versions of iTunes and iCloud (**not the Microsoft Store versions**) before installing Sideloadly. You can download them [here](https://www.apple.com/itunes/download/win64) and [here](https://updates.cdn-apple.com/2020/windows/001-39935-20200911-1A70AA56-F448-11EA-8CC0-99D41950005E/iCloudSetup.exe).

1. Download and install Sideloadly from their [downloads page](https://sideloadly.io/#download).

2. Download the latest iOS IPA file from the [Releases](https://github.com/Hessflix/Client/releases) page and save it to your computer.

3. Plug your device into your computer and open iTunes.

4. Click the device icon in the top left next to the navigation buttons.

5. Ensure **Sync with this device over Wi-Fi** is checked.

6. Click Apply, then Done, then close iTunes.

7. Open Sideloadly and click the Open IPA button in the top left. Select the IPA you downloaded earlier.

8. Make sure your device is listed under **iDevice**. It will usually look like this: `<device name> (<iOS version>) <UDID> @USB`.

9. Enter your Apple ID in the **Apple ID** box. Creating a second Apple ID is recommended, but not required.

10. Click Start. You will be prompted to enter your Apple ID password. Enter it and allow any two-factor authentication, if required.

11. The installation process will take a while. Once it's finished, you will see the Hessflix icon on your home screen or in your App Library.

> [!NOTE]
> Your password is only used for authentication to Apple's servers. It is not sent to any third parties.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Once installed, Hessflix will only be valid for 7 days. Enabling auto refresh will keep the app from expiring (this should already be enabled). Your computer needs to be on for this to occur.

## Docker

You can install Hessflix on your server to provide an alternate Jellyfin dashboard.

Copy the contents of the [docker-compose.yml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Hessflix/Client/refs/heads/develop/docker-compose.yml) file and save it to your server.

Run `docker-compose up -d` to start the container. It will be available on `http://<server-ip>`.

> [!TIP]
> We recommend changing the `BASE_URL` environment variable to the URL you use to access Jellyfin, as this will skip entering it when you load the web UI.
